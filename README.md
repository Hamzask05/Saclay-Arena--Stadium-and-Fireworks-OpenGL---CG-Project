Project Overview
As part of the Introduction to Computer Graphics project, we chose to create a 3D scene representing a football stadium.
This choice is closely related to a current context, particularly the fact that our country is hosting and organizing a major sporting event: the Africa Cup of Nations.
This project represents a fusion between our passion for sport and our academic identity. We transformed a classic sports venue into a stadium featuring the colors of Université Paris-Saclay and Polytech.
Modeling with Blender
Most of the visual elements in the scene were designed using Blender. Our work mainly focused on creating original objects.
The PPS Mascot
This is the central element of the project. We modeled the school mascot (the bull) and used it as the base for both the players and the referee. This required careful work on organic shapes in order to preserve the cartoon-like appearance of the original character. This approach allowed us to unify the visual style of the scene while strongly integrating the school’s identity.
Texturing Work
Texturing played a key role in personalizing the scene.
Texture Mapping:
We imported and applied the school logo directly onto the central pitch. We also placed the university flag on the advertising panels surrounding the field.
Materials and Colors:
The stands were colored blue to match the school’s identity. The pitch uses a green checkerboard shader to achieve a realistic football field appearance.
Flags:
Custom textures displaying “Université Paris-Saclay” were applied to all the flagpoles surrounding the stadium.
Learning Blender
This project was also an opportunity for us to discover Blender for the first time.
At the beginning, the software seemed complex due to the large number of available features. However, as the project progressed, we gradually learned how to use it more efficiently and gained a better understanding of its workflow.
We particularly enjoyed working with Blender, as it allows a 3D scene to come to life in a concrete and highly visual way.
Importing Models into OpenGL
After the modeling phase in Blender, we moved on to the second stage of the project: importing the models into OpenGL. To achieve this, we conducted research and discovered a library that greatly simplifies the process: Assimp (Open Asset Import Library).
We started by familiarizing ourselves with Assimp by importing simple models, beginning with a lemon. Gradually, we increased the complexity of the imported models: a textured football, the Polytech mascot, and finally the stadium along with all its components.
This final model alone contains more than one hundred meshes, allowing us to thoroughly test the robustness and efficiency of our import pipeline.
